================================
Running the TCK from the source 
================================

1. Checkout TCK workspace.
     git clone git@github.com:eclipse-ee4j/mail-tck.git
2. Make sure maven is installed and in your PATH.
3. Open lib/ts.jte for editing.
   Save and close the file.
4. See "Setting up the mailbox" below.
5. Execute 'mvn clean install'.
6. After the TCK suite finishes running, the report can be found in
   target/surefire-reports

================================
  Setting up the mailbox
================================

a) Install IMAP server software on a machine.
   Note that the IMAP server must support IMAP4 (RFC 1730) or
   IMAP4-rev1 (RFC 2060).
b) Create one user account with password on this server.
   Note that a password is necessary.
c) To populate the mailbox of the user you just created, compile and execute: 
     mvn clean install -DskipTests
     java -jar target/jakarta.mail-tck-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -s test1 -d dest_url
   where dest_url is of the form - protocol://username:password@hostname/
   For example:
     java -jar target/jakarta.mail-tck-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -f -s target/test-classes/mailboxes/test1 -d imap://username:password@domain/test1
d) Install SMTP software on a machine.
   Setup a user account so that the SMTP server can
   deliver email to that account. 
e) Now open the lib/ts.properties file,
   scroll to the end of the file and and set the following variables:

   JAVAMAIL_SERVER=<server on which mailserver to be used is installed>
   JAVAMAIL_USERNAME=<username of the user account you created in step b>
   JAVAMAIL_PASSWORD=<password of the user account you created in step b>
   JAVAMAIL_ROOT_PATH=<points to the folder, under which your test mailboxes
			exist. This variable must be set to "" or "/" if your
			mailboxes are directly under the root>
   SMTP_USERNAME=<smtp username to use. Usually, this is the same as the
			imap username if you are using a mail server>
   SMTP_DOMAIN=<domain name of the server eg: sun.com, aol.com>
f) Save and close the file.
