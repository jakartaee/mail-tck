Quick Start Instructions for Jakarta Mail TCK

================================
Running the TCK from the source 
================================

1. Checkout TCK workspace in TCKHOME (e.g., "mail-tck").
     git clone git@github.com:eclipse-ee4j/mail-tck.git
   Change directory to $TCKHOME.
2. Place jakarta.activation-api.jar, angus-activation.jar
   , jakarta.mail-api.jar and the implementation of mail (for example angus-mail)
   in any location. Let's call it JARPATH. 
   It's usually simplest to just put them in $TCKHOME.
3. Make sure ant is installed and in your PATH.
4. Open $TCKHOME/lib/ts.jte and $TCKHOME/lib/ts.pluggability.jte for editing.
   In the file set the TS_HOME, JARPATH and JAVA_HOME.
   Save and close the file.
5. In TCKHOME, execute 'ant build'.  This will compile all source under
   $TCKHOME/tests and $TCKHOME/harness into $TCKHOME/classes, $TCKHOME/classes-harness,
   $TCKHOME/classes-pluggability and $TCKHOME/classes-providers.
6. See "Setting up the mailbox" below.
7. In $TCKHOME, execute the following command to start the TCK in batch mode:
     'ant run run.pluggability'
   Alternatively, you can run 'ant gui' to start the TCK in gui mode.

    If you are running on Windows, change the following property in
    lib/ts.jti:

    jtwiz.environment.env=mailWindows

8. After the TCK suite finishes running, the report can be found in
    $TCKHOME/JTreport/index.html and $TCKHOME/JTreport-Pluggability/index.html


================================
  Setting up the mailbox
================================

a) Install IMAP server software on a machine.
   Note that the IMAP server must support IMAP4 (RFC 1730) or
   IMAP4-rev1 (RFC 2060).
b) Create one user account with password on this server.
   Note that a password is necessary.
c) To populate the mailbox of the user you just created,
   go to $TCKHOME/tests/mailboxes directory. Now compile and execute: 
     javac fpopulate.java
     java fpopulate -s test1 -d dest_url
   where dest_url is of the form - protocol://username:password@hostname/  
d) Install SMTP software on a machine.
   Setup a user account so that the SMTP server can
   deliver email to that account. 
e) Now open the $TCKHOME/lib/ts.jte file,
   scroll to the end of the file and and set the following variables:

   JAVAMAIL_SERVER=<server on which mailserver to be used is installed>
   JAVAMAIL_USERNAME=<username of the user account you created in step b>
   JAVAMAIL_PASSWORD=<password of the user account you created in step b>
   JAVAMAIL_ROOT_PATH=<points to the folder, under which your test mailboxes
			exist. This variable must be set to "" or "/" if your
			mailboxes are directly under the root>
   SMTP_USERNAME=<smtp username to use. Usually, this is the same as the
			imap username if you are using a mail server>
   SMTP_DOMAIN=<domain name of the server eg: sun.com, aol.com>
f) Save and close the file. 


================================
      Releasing the TCK
================================

1. Follow steps 1 through 10 as listed in the
   "Running the TCK from the source" section.
2. If you need to record a sig file, in TCKHOME, execute 'ant record.sigtest'.
   This will create a new sig file in TCKHOME for the version of Java SE you
   are using. 
3. Open $TCKHOME/lib/ts.jte and $TCKHOME/lib/ts.pluggability.jte for editing.
   In the file, unset the TCKHOME, JARPATH, JAVA_HOME, JAVAMAIL_SERVER,
   JAVAMAIL_USERNAME, JAVAMAIL_PASSWORD, SMTP_USERNAME and SMTP_DOMAIN
   variables. Save and close the file. 
4. In the workspace now execute:
     ant -f release.xml [-Dversion=tck_version]

   Where tck_version is the mail TCK version number

   This command zips the necessary files into mail-tck-[tck_version].zip.

   Note that this command assumes the TCK will be installed in a directory
   named "mail-tck".
